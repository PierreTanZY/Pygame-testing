Following 'Understanding framerate independence and deltatime' youtube tutorial created by ClearCode.

Imported own assests

Created 4 test.py files:-

test1.py is the basic code with no framerate independence and the object will move at different speed in different fps.

test2.py has framerate independece but can be unconsistent.

test3.py is the best way to achieve accurate and consistent framerate independence.

test4.py is an example for appling framerate independece to most in-game mechanics similar to test3.py
