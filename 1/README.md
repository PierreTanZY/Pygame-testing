Made two python files:- 
test1.py mainly uses functions whilst test2.py heavily incorporates sprite classes.

Overall, 
I learned alot in this tutorial such as the basics in pygame, displaying surfaces, utilising the built in sound system, intepreting user input, managing a score system and most importantly, learnt the importance of organised and structured code. 
When writing, debugging, and deciphering my code, there was a stark difference in between the readability between the two files - Despite them both having the same amount of lines, test1.py came off as chaotic and cryptic whereas test2.py read as structured and orderly.

Update,
Added test3.py, in this iteration I have added music and sound toggle buttons in the end game screen. Fit with feedback animations and the use of sprite classes and event loops to call the appropiate functions. 
Made without any help or tutorials! Just the docs.
