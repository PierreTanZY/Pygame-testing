Imported own assets

The useful tool learned and created here is the debug.py file which allows users to import it into their own code. This lets the user print out a variablle or multiple at every frame of test1.py to debug or gain more understanding of the code. This is arguably better than having print statements because your terminal may be flooded with too many print statements, not allowing the debugger to catch it in time or look too messy, hence debug.py solves that issue with the only downside being no logs of the variable. Overall, a useful debug tool and neat trick to know!
